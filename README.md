**RAG-Based Chatbot Demo**

This repository contains a simple demonstration of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. The chatbot combines document retrieval with a generative language model to provide contextually relevant and factually accurate responses.

**Features**
**Document Retrieval:** Uses FAISS and Sentence-BERT for fast and accurate document matching.
**Generative Response:** Leverages BART to create human-like responses based on retrieved context.
**Customizable Knowledge Base:** Easily adaptable to various domains (e.g., banking, finance, etc.).
